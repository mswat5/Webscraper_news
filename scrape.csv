Mars rover digs up intriguing clues in the hunt for life beyond Earth,Joel Achenbach,"November 23, 2022 at 2:00 p.m. EST","

On the floor of a shallow crater on Mars, the NASA rover Perseverance has hit what scientists are hoping is pay dirt. Martian rocks excavated by the rover show signs of a watery past and are loaded with the kind of organic molecules that are the foundation for life as we know it.

Scientists collaborating on the mission also say the rock samples, which the rover has cached in tubes for a future return to Earth, have the right chemical recipe to preserve evidence of ancient Martian life, if it ever existed.

The new Perseverance research is detailed in three extensive studies published Wednesday, one in the journal Science and two in the journal Science Advances. The journal reports are highly technical and devoid of hype â daring to be dull as dirt â but the scientists involved translate them into a more exciting tale.

âItâs amazing. In pretty much every rock weâre finding organics,â said Abigail Allwood, a geologist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, which operates the rover and the broader Mars Sample Return mission.

One of the studies concluded that the rocks in the crater experienced three different events in which they were exposed to water.

âCrucially, conditions in the rock during each time that water migrated through it could have supported small communities of microorganisms,â lead author Michael Tice, a geologist at Texas A&M University, said in an email. In a subsequent interview, he added, âWeâre not going to know until we get the samples back to Earth.â

Perseverance made a bulls-eye landing in Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021, and has been roaming it since, caching rock samples along the way for later scrutiny back on Earth. This is an ambitious, multiphase mission that will require NASA and its partner, the European Space Agency, to send another vehicle to the surface of Mars with the capability of launching samples into orbit. A spacecraft would then carry those samples back to Earth for laboratory research. The precise timetable is still to be determined, but NASA is hoping to have the samples on home turf in the early 2030s.

This study of Mars is part of the efflorescence of the young field of astrobiology, which includes the search for potentially habitable worlds and the first example of extraterrestrial life. Despite the efforts of generations of scientists, and notwithstanding the claims of UFO buffs, the discovery of life beyond Earth remains aspirational.

Even finding organics â life-friendly molecules with combinations of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen â is a far cry from discovering life or even proof of its presence in the past. Such molecules can be either biological or nonbiological in origin.

Still, Mars is front and center in NASAâs search because it has many favorable traits. Mars probably was far more Earthlike about 3 billion years ago, with warmer and wetter conditions. Life may have once existed on Earth and Mars simultaneously, and it is possible that it originated on Mars and spread to Earth via meteorites. And though the surface now is an arid wasteland, the planet could have liquid water in significant quantities beneath the surface, and possibly âcrypticâ life.

Although the Perseverance rover does not have instruments to chemically detect living organisms if they exist today, its instruments give scientists the ability to study the Martian surface at a level of detail never before possible.

One of the new papers more closely examining Marsâs chemistry has delivered a surprise for geologists. They had assumed that they were going to dig up a bunch of sedimentary rocks. Instead the rocks are volcanic.

Jezero Crater formed in an impact event â a rock slamming into Mars â at least 3.5 billion years ago. The shallow crater clearly had water in it long ago. This could be determined from orbital images showing the remnants of a delta where a river flowed into the lake. Planetary geologists had assumed the floor of the crater was covered in sedimentary rock, formed from dirt and debris that slowly accumulated at the bottom of the lake.

If such sedimentary rock was ever there, itâs gone now. It may have eroded away, Tice said. The lack of sedimentary rock could mean that the lake didnât last very long, which would be disappointing for the astrobiologists. Life as we know it needs water, and it takes time for more-complex life-forms to evolve. If the lake didnât linger, life might have struggled to take root.

The volcanic rocks are not a disappointment, though, because they preserve loads of information about the Martian past, including the presence of organic molecules, scientists said. The presence of organic material on Mars had been confirmed in previous missions, but their precise nature and chemistry canât be discerned through this kind of long-distance research and will require laboratory scrutiny on Earth, according to Bethany Ehlmann, a planetary scientist at Caltech and co-author of two of the new papers.

âAre they merely organics that kind of washed into the system â maybe from meteoritic material that was just part of the water? That would be the least exciting. Or are they little niches of microbial life living in the cavities of these rocks? That would be the most exciting,â Ehlmann said.

She added that the rover âis collecting an awesome set of samples to reveal Marsâs environmental history in all of its forms â the volcanic history, the history of water, the relationship of organics to those water-rich environments.â

All of this is an attempt to solve the fundamental mystery of Mars: What went wrong? How and when and why did this planet that apparently was congenial to life turn into such a harsh place? The Red Planet may not be a dead planet â the coronerâs report is incomplete â but it certainly resembles one.

Scientists point to something Mars lacks today: a global magnetic field like Earthâs. Such a field protects our atmosphere from the corrosive effects of the solar wind â high-energy particles steadily streaming from the sun that can strip away lighter molecules. Mars also lacks plate tectonics, the geological process that on Earth recycles the crust and continues to spew water and nutrient-rich lavas through active volcanoes.

Somewhere along the way, Marsâs magnetic field died, and then it became a different kind of planet. It lost almost all of its atmosphere. It became a frigid desert world. How quickly that happened is unknown, but thatâs something that might be revealed by the volcanic rocks in the crater.

Magma contains some amount of iron, which is sensitive to a planetâs magnetism. As lava cools, it crystallizes into igneous rock, freezing electrons within iron-bearing minerals into patterns that could reveal a magnetic fieldâs traits, such as its orientation.

Benjamin Weiss, a planetary scientist at MIT and co-author of two of the papers, said in an email, âOn balance, we are actually super lucky that there are igneous rocks in the crater, and that we happened to land right on them, since they are ideal for determining ages and studying the past history of Marsâ magnetic field.â

Once the mission can send its precious rock collection back to Earth, scientists may finally be able to tell if life ever found a foothold on Mars â which would raise new questions about whether, despite the dramatic transformation of the planet, life somehow managed to persevere."

âOpening the gates of hellâ: Musk says he will revive banned accounts,Taylor Lorenz,"Updated November 24, 2022 at 6:14 p.m. EST|Published November 24, 2022 at 2:45 p.m. EST","

Elon Musk plans to reinstate nearly all previously banned Twitter accounts â to the alarm of activists and online trust and safety experts.

After posting a Twitter poll asking, âShould Twitter offer a general amnesty to suspended accounts, provided that they have not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam?â in which 72.4 percent of the respondents voted yes, Musk declared, âAmnesty begins next week.â

The Twitter CEO did not respond Thursday to a request for comment from The Washington Post. The poll garnered more than 3 million votes.

The mass return of users who had been banned for such offenses as violent threats, harassment and misinformation will have a significant impact on the platform, experts said. And many questioned how such a resurrection would be handled, given that itâs unclear what Musk means by âegregious spamâ and the difficulty of separating out users who have âbroken the law,â which vary widely by jurisdiction and country.

âApple and Google need to seriously start exploring booting Twitter off the app store,â said Alejandra Caraballo, clinical instructor at Harvard Lawâs cyberlaw clinic. âWhat Musk is doing is existentially dangerous for various marginalized communities. Itâs like opening the gates of hell in terms of the havoc it will cause. People who engaged in direct targeted harassment can come back and engage in doxing, targeted harassment, vicious bullying, calls for violence, celebration of violence. I canât even begin to state how dangerous this will be.â

This is the second time in a week that Musk has used a Twitter poll to seemingly make a major decision related to the platform. On Nov. 18, he restored former president Donald Trumpâs account after 52 percent of a pollâs respondents said he should do so. âVox Populi, Vox Dei,â Musk tweeted, Latin for âthe voice of the people is the voice of God.â

On that day, he also unilaterally reinstated at least 11 high-profile far-right Twitter accounts, including Jordan Peterson, a professor who was banned from Twitter for misgendering a trans person, and the Babylon Bee, a conservative media company. He also restored Project Veritas, a site that was frequently accused of misrepresenting events it commented on and banned âfor repeated violations of Twitterâs private information policy,â and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greeneâs personal account, which had been banned since January for violating the platformâs covid-19 misinformation policies and pushing violent and extreme rhetoric.

Green posted a photo Thursday showing herself and other right wing figures who have had their accounts recently reinstated at a dinner table with Musk. âHappy Thanksgiving!â she wrote.

Experts say that bots and bad actors can easily skew the results of a Twitter poll, and so basing decisions on one is irresponsible. âA Twitter poll can be manipulated, thereâs nothing scientific or rigorous in any way about what heâs doing,â said Sarah T. Roberts, an associate professor at UCLA and faculty director for UCLAâs Center for Critical Internet Inquiry, who previously worked at Twitter researching content moderation processes.

âBefore Elon took over,â Roberts added, âthere were entire teams of people who did market and user research, who followed rigorous protocols established to conduct this kind of research. Suddenly, heâs running Twitter off of completely unscientific polls that are polling unknown people, and certainly not any kind of demographically representative swath of people.â

Many predict the restoration of banned accounts will help bring on the âfree-for-all hellscapeâ that Musk had promised advertisers would not come to pass shortly after he took possession of the platform.

âThis would be a major disaster especially in Africa where State sponsored Ghost accounts were suspended for endangering human rights activists & journalists,â Hopewell Chinâono, a journalist in Africa tweeted. âYou would have allowed vile people to put our lives in danger as journalists! You will have blood on your hands @elonmusk.â

Whether Musk can do what the Twitter poll seeks is a matter of debate. He has laid off leaders of the trust and safety team, which would normally handle the logistics of reactivating the accounts. And separating out those who âbroke the lawâ is entirely dependent on whether Twitter has detailed documentation for each suspension. Without such a legal filter, which would be dependent on state and local laws for each tweet, every account would require a thorough review, given how laws vary widely by country and region.

Madeleine Burkholder, a senior technical solutions engineer who has worked on consumer products managing spam, said Muskâs ask is nonsensical. âEgregious spamming is not a technical term,â she said, and most record keeping at major tech companies doesnât include questions of local governmental legal codes. The norm is to simply note whether an account violated a companyâs terms of service, which are rules set by the platform, not a government entity.

âIt gets really hairy to pull these threads apart and figure out what the exact behavior was that led to their suspension,â Burkholder said. âWas it an innocent mistake? Was it malicious? How malicious was it? â¦ Doing that on a single case is challenging, trying to do it for every account ever, youâre guaranteed to make mistakes.â

Angelo Carusone, chairman and president of Media Matters, a nonprofit advocacy group and media watchdog, said that Muskâs decision could mean bringing back networks of individuals that include the American Nazi Party and âa whole bunch of 8chan, 4chan, conspiracy theorists who engage in harassment and abuse.â 8chan and 4chan are two message boards known for their racist and antisemitic posts.

Reversing the suspensions would mean âturning Twitter into a one-stop shop for operationalizing doxing and harassment, and an engine of radicalization,â Carusone said. âItâs a red pill Pez dispenser.â

And quitting Twitter wonât keep you safe. âEven if youâre not on Twitter, you can still be the recipient of these campaigns,â he said. He predicted that public health officials, election officials, journalists and teachers will all be targeted.

âConducting major moderation and enforcement decisions on a whim is troubling CEO behavior,â said Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of digital justice and civil rights at Free Press, a nonprofit advocacy group. âMusk, under the auspices of democracy, is legitimizing decisions that will have deeply dangerous consequences in the real world.â

Benavidez said that organizations including Free Press have spent years educating tech giants on complex trust and safety issues and âpressuring them to understand the really delicate and complex role they play in mitigating harm caused to real people.â If âgeneral amnestyâ is granted for the majority of suspended accounts, âIt will be open season for people suspended for hate, harassment, disinformation, conspiracies and extremism,â Benavidez said. âItâs open season in the most dangerous ways.â

âYou have journalists, activists in authoritarian regimes in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia who are now even at the mercy of even more vicious trolls with no ability to fight back,â said Caraballo. âItâs literally life or death for people.â

The lifting of the suspensions was especially troubling to LGBTQ activists, coming just days after a mass killing at the Club Q in Colorado Springs killed five and wounded 18. Several of the restored accounts had previously been suspended for hateful rhetoric toward the gay and trans community, and Musk has been criticized for replying to Tim Pool, a right-wing YouTube star who falsely claimed the club had hosted a âgrooming event,â and other anti-LGBTQ accounts.

âItâs a slap in the face to LGBTQ people,â Caraballo said.

But conservatives have largely embraced Musk and his decision making. He frequently engages with far-right influencers, such as Andy NgÃ´ and Ian Miles Cheong, on Twitter, and has said that the company has propagated âfar left San Francisco/Berkeley views.â In reality, Twitterâs algorithms amplify conservative content more than that of the political left, the companyâs own research found last year. And, in 2020, right-leaning voices far outweighed liberals in driving conversations on influential topics leading up to the election, analysis by Politico and the Institute for Strategic Dialogue showed.

As Musk teases his reinstatement plan, trolls have become emboldened.

Far-right users of the message board 4Chan celebrated the amnesty announcement after encouraging members of the message board community to vote in Muskâs poll. On one thread, rife with slurs, 4chan users who said they were previously banned for telling vaccinated people to kill themselves, and making racist, antisemitic, misogynistic, and anti-LGBTQ comments, expressed excitement over the possibility of being reinstated. The users discussed resuming the activities that had gotten them banned. In some cases users said theyâd had between 12 and 17 accounts removed for violating community guidelines.

âSuperspreaders of hate, abuse and harassment will be the only people to benefit from this latest decision by Twitter,"" said Imran Ahmed, founder and CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit focused on online hate and misinformation. âThe choice for advertisers has never been starker: stick around and back Elon Musk, or protect their brands and ensure their marketing dollars arenât used to enable the spread of hate, abuse and disinformation.â

In the days after he took over Twitter, Musk initially promised not to change the siteâs moderation policies and restore accounts until after heâd appointed a moderation council. But more recently Musk has backtracked on naming such a council and has laid off hundreds of the Twitter employees whose job it was to police posts on the site.

Dozens of Twitterâs advertisers have paused spending with the platform in the wake of Muskâs takeover, concerned about how his approach to content moderation might affect the siteâs tone."
